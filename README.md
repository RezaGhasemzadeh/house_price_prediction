## Multiple Linear Regression
In this kind of regression we have more than two parameters, I solved this problem using Linear Regression and Gradient Descent algorithm and compared results at the end
It is clear that the first approach(Linear Regression) gives us a more accurate answer, but I wanted to show you the effect of normalization in Gradient Descent algorithm's performance
Without normalization Gradient Descent algorithm's performance it terrible, its good to ask ourselves why?
